# CARTOColors
CARTOColors are a set of custom color palettes built on top of well-known standards for color use on maps, with next generation enhancements for the web and CARTO basemaps. Choose from a selection of sequential, diverging, or qualitative schemes for your next CARTO powered visualization.

This repo provides resources to use CARTOColors as a node module inspired by https://github.com/saikocat/colorbrewer.

## Credits/Additional Information
+ CARTOColors as a node module inspired by https://github.com/saikocat/colorbrewer
+ In the file `cartocolor.js`, you will find CARTOColor schemes tagged as `sequential`, `diverging`, and `qualititative` and their unique [scheme name](https://github.com/CartoDB/CartoColor/wiki/CARTOColor-Scheme-Names).
+ In addition to CARTOColors, `cartocolor.js` includes [ColorBrewer](colorbrewer.org) schemes that are available for use in [CARTO Builder](carto.com/builder). You can find those definitions [here](https://github.com/CartoDB/CartoColor/blob/master/cartocolor.js#L1836-L1849).
+ CARTOColors includes a color-blind friendly qualitative scheme named [Safe](https://github.com/CartoDB/CartoColor/blob/master/cartocolor.js#L1633-L1733) we included this scheme based on the research and recommendations of [Paul Tol](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/data/colourschemes.pdf).
